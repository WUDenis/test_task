# INSTRUCTIONS

In word search puzzles you get a square of letters and have to find
specific words in them.

For example:

```text
jefblpepre
camdcimgtc
oivokprjsm
pbwasqroua
rixilelhrs
wolcqlirpc
screeaumgr
alxhpburyi
jalaycalmp
clojurermt
```

There are several programming languages hidden in the above square.

Words can be hidden in all kinds of directions: left-to-right,
right-to-left, vertical and diagonal.

Given a puzzle and a list of words return the location of the first
and last letter of each word.


## RULES

- Keep your solution in a file named `search.py`.
- Passing all unit tests is a plus, but not mandatory.
- Try to show all your skills. Using linting - formatting tools,
  preferring type checking, adding `pyproject.toml`; all of these will
  affect your score.
- Do not spend more than 8 hours.
- You can send your solution in a folder with archiving it. Or if you
  prefer to publish your solution, share the repository link with us.
- Never pass any company name into the code. Keep it anonymous.
